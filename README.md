# BSW Web Executive Selection Drive
Hi all.  
This is a week long assignment that won't be taking more than 4 hours in total. The reason of keeping it week long as many of you might not be having time to work on some specific days. We apologize for sending the assignment late.  
You need to download the code and run it on your machine locally. PHP is not used. Your requirements are to make page(s) corresponding to the currently deployed site. You can also see this link from where the template is picked up : https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/  
There are many pages that can be deployed like
>Any page from the Resources tab in the site (http://bsw.iitd.ac.in/)  
>Any page from the BSW Resources tab(except Question Paper page, its hard to implement) in the site (http://bsw.iitd.ac.in/)  
>Any page from the FAQ tab in the site(http://bsw.iitd.ac.in/).  
>Any of the Counselling or Contact Us Page.  

You need to make any of the page you find easy or interesing coherent with the template used in the site. You can see the currently deployed site at http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~cs1160315/bswnewsite/ . You can also use this awesome page: http://htmlpreview.github.io/ and deploy the code directly from the github automatically.

You have to submit the code by mailing it at akshat.khare.backup@gmail.com by 20 May 2018. Forking the code and submitting the pull request is not encouraged at this is a competition and it will lead to cheating the code by other contendors

## Important Instructions

- Mail me with your preference of the page that you'd be liking to create (at least one page).
- If you are beginner you might like looking up W3 tutorials of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. That would be enough for completing the assignment. There are many files in the repo that you need not be worrying about. Only code that is of much concern is index.html. Understand the template mentioned above more carefully if you are having difficullty solving the assignment.
- Headers and Footers should be similar to the template or the index.html in the repo.
- You can use any online resource and make the page look more attractive. However it is advised if you can make the page look satisfactorially aesthetic make another page if you have time. Efforts on aesthetic will be rewarded.
- Since this is a very easy assignment where you can even inspect the code from the current site and integrate it in the template. So this assignment is just a measure if you are really interested in becoming the tech face of Official Student Body of IIT DELHI: BSW.
- Also link the page you made with the main page so that it can be reached directly by clicking on the main page.
- Also upload a text file containing not more than 50 words as the statement of your work done.
- Keep yourself updated with this github page's readme as instructions may change if there is any issue. Star the repo and watch the repo page to get timely updates on any change 
- You can mail me any queries regarding the assignment on the email mentioned above or raise the issue in the repo itself. I will try to solve it as quickly as possible.
- ***Cheating won't help. My brother is in 8th  standard and he can make the page by giving 10 hours. It would be really sad if you are cheating in such an easy assignment.***
- If the page is nice enough it will be directly integrated with the official site and credits would be given even if you are not selected.


### Have fun coding it
